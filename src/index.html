	<h1>Github pages test with Gulp</h1>

	<p>
		OK, I have a project folder, with /src and /public.
	</p>
	<p>
		The project folder has a git repo and a /src folder. It also has a /public folder that has its own git repo. The project folder's .gitignore includes /public. So the project folder will have a different github repo than the actual github pages.
	</p>
	<p>
		So I can work on the /src code, send it through Gulp to transpile and minify and put in /public, then commit and push it to the &quotsrc&quot; repo, then commit and push the /public to my github pages separately.
	</p>
	<p>
		The editor only needs the project folder. But I'll need 2 terminals, one for each repo.
	</p>
	<p>
		'gh-pages' is cool, but that won't work for this as far as I can tell.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was originally doing this with Webpack, but was running into FOUC problems. Doing it without the Webpack bundling
		and using Gulp to run tasks works better for this.
